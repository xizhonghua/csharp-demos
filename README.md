## C# Demos

### MultiConfig
12/03/2014

A config class each of whose property is read from a single column config file (values only). Before we need to load file and assign to each property manually, in this demo I show how to use **custom attribute**, **reflection** and **generic type**" to automatically load all the config files and convert it to proper type for each property.
