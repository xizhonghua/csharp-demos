## C# Demos
In this repository I will show some cool demos of C# language features.

### MultiConfig
A config class each of whose property is read from a single column config file (values only). Before we need to load file and assign to each property manually, in this demo I show how to use **custom attributes** and **reflection** to automatically load all the config files and convert it to proper type for each property.
